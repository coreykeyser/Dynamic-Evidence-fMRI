Workflow basics:

Fork the repo into your own account.
Git clone that repo into your computer.
Type "npm install --save" in terminal while you are in the foodCoOper folder
Once you are done with your share of the work, then do a pull request from your repo into master.
I will look over the changes and then merge and push to heroku
Git and Cooperative build etiquette:

Communicate heavily about any changes you want to make to the main repo
ASK QUESTIONS! Text me if you need something
Comment the hell out of whatever you do, write a few sentences about the structure of the file you are working on at the beginnning that explains the logic of the file
don't write everything in one file! try to break files up depending on the functions, 1 big and complicated file is worse than 5 well structured files that work together
don't be redundant, never write the same code twice, make sure that the functions can work with configs
write all the configs for the file at the beginning, make it work well enough so that you can understand and change the code within the first couple lines
