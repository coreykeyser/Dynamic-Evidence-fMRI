If you haven't downloaded git on your computer, download it. And if you don't have a good code editor yet, I'd suggest trying atom. You should also download python if you haven't already....For the R coding, download R and Rtools and work through Rstudio.

Once you have that setup, go into your terminal and create a folder for project. Then cd into that folder it and type "git clone [the copied link from the green "clone" button in the top right of the main page]." This will download all of the materials to your computer. If you have any questions about how to run it on your computer tet corey at 3303280334.
