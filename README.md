# Dynamic-Evidence-fMRI
Workflow basics:

If you haven't downloaded git on your computer, download it. And if you don't have a good code editor yet, I'd suggest trying atom. You should also download python if you haven't already....For the R coding, download R and Rtools and work through Rstudio.

Once you have that setup, go into your terminal and create a folder for project. Then cd into that folder it and type "git clone [the copied link from the green "clone" button in the top right of the main page]." This will download all of the materials to your computer. If you have any questions about how to run it on your computer tet corey at 3303280334.

HELPFUL GIT COMMANDS
to clone your directory-->"git clone [the copied link from the green "clone" button in the top right of the main page]"
to update your directory-->'git pull origin'
 
THE FILES IN THE GITHUB DO NOT INCLUDE THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP SINCE THAT DOESN'T NEED MANIPULATED BUT IF YOU WANT TO BROWSE IT JUST REACH OUT TO ME AND I CAN GIVE YOU MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS.
 
FILE GUIDE: the main data source is evidenceAccumulationMaster, this has the coherences for every trial along with the responses for 5 different subjects. "fast rlcca.r" and 'LCCA.r' are the main files for the actual LCA code. 
[INSERT NOAH EXPLANATION HERE]
 
fMRI project:
creating a joint model between behvioral responses in LCA and the BOLD response from fMRI
 
Math Psych:
Strictly adapting, fitting, and performing parameter recovery on the continuous LCA....and maybe more stuff
1. adapting LCA code for the continuous experiment (done)
2. determining parameters
3. performing parameter recovery
